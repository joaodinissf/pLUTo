# pLUTo - In-House Simulator

## Steps to Reproduce

You may reproduce our results in one of two ways:

### Option #1 (Recommended): Step-by-Step Instructions Using the Jupyter Notebook

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x available on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies (NumPy and pandas) using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Launch the simulation walkthrough file by opening `sim_walkthrough.ipynb` as a Jupyter notebook.

### Option #2: Manually Execution of the In-House Simulator

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x available on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies (NumPy and pandas) using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. `cd` into the `pluto_sim` directory.
4. Run the simulator with `python pluto_sim.py`

## Expected Behaviour

After running step 4 above, a directory named `pysim` should be created under `pluto_sim`.
This directory should contain three files identical to the ones provided in the folder `pysim_reference`.
